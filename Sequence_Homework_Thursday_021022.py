#     print(number,'*',v,'=',v*number)








# Small

# 1. Sum the Numbers
# Create a list of numbers, print their sum.

# num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 5]
# print(sum(num))









# 2. Largest Number
# Create a list of numbers, print the largest of the numbers.

# num = [1, 8, 456, 4, 5, 6]

# print("The largest number in this list is: ",max(num))










# 3. Smallest Number
# Create a list of numbers, print the smallest of the numbers.

# num = [1, 8, 456, 4, 5, 6]
# print("The smallest number in this list it: ", min(num))











# 4. Even Numbers
# Create a list of numbers, print each number in the list that is even.

# num = [1, 8, 456, 4, 5, 6, 99, 4309, 8490, 4830]

# for index in num:
#     if index % 2 == 0:
#         print(index)










# 5. Positive Numbers
# Create a list of numbers, print each number in the list that is greater than zero.

# num = [-5, 0, 1, 8, 456, 4, 5, 6]
# result = [v for v in num if v > 0]

# print(result)










# 6. Positive Numbers II
# Create a list of numbers, create a new list which contains every number in the given list which is positive.

# num = [-15, 1, 5, 9, 8, -78, 86, -4, -1, 0]
# posnum = [v for v in num if v > 0]

# print(posnum)










# 7. Multiply a list
# Create a list of numbers, and a single factor (also a number), create a new list consisting of each of the numbers in the first list multiplied by the factor. Print this list.

# num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# result = [v * 3 for v in num]

# print(result)









# 8. Reverse a String
